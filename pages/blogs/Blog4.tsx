        We were bar hopping and happened upon a cool looking bar with cool
        looking people. We had been drinking beer all night, I thought finally
        this is the place for a <i>g√≠ntonica</i>. The bartender made them in the
        bulbous wine glasses with a slice of some citrus I'm forgetting. The
        drinks came with trail mix that had gummy worms in it. We enjoyed them
        sitting in recycled seats from an airplane.
